                <p>I started as a PhD student in the School of Education, but have now moved my research to Computer Science, my advisor is Tom Yeh</p>
                <p style="text-align: left">I research:</p>

                <h2>Discussion I'm Looking For:</h2>
                <p>How generalizable is this type of model (i.e., outside of CS)?</p>
                <p>When I get my own classroom (starting Fall 2015), how can I better achieve my goals?</p>
                <p>What future metrics would you like to see?</p>
